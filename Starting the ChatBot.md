### Starting up botpress

* Open a terminal window. (Alternatively named Console/Command prompt, depending on your operating system).
Navigate to your botpress folder. (Type `cd` followed by the path to the botpress folder. e.g. `cd C:\botpress` in windows, or `cd /home/username/botpress` in Linux or `cd /Applications/botpress` in MacOS. This of course depends on what you named the folder, and the location of it.)
* Type `./bp` to run botpress. (Alternatively just `bp` or `bp.exe`, again OS dependent)
You will see text appearing displaying the startup of the ChatBot. Botpress will now be up and running!
* To stop botpress at any point, press ctrl+C or just close the terminal window.
* In your web browser, navigate to `http://localhost:3000`. You will be shown a login window.

*Note that if you have anything already running on your machine that uses this port, botpress will attempt to use the next available one. This should be noted on the startup text.*

It will ask you to sign up. All you need to provide is an email and passsword. These can be anything you choose as they are purely used for login security. Remember these credentials as you will need them again to log back in.
