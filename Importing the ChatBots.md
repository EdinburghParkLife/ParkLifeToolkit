The window you are given allows you to create the bot ID for the ChatBot. This will be used as part of the web address the end users will visit when they use the bot. So this should be something succinct and meaningful.

Then select the bot archive. Choose the `Parklife ChatBot.tgz` to import.

Once imported, the ChatBot will appear in the bot list.
Now selected ‘configure’ next to this newly imported bot.
Here, you can change the Name of the bot, Description and More Details such as website and contact details.
You can also change the Bot avatar, which will be displayed to end users, and the cover picture.
