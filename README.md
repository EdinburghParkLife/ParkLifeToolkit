## ChatBot setup

Follow these steps to create and use your own ChatBot:

## ChatBot example

The Parklife project has multiple ChatBots for parks in and around Edinburgh. One such ChatBot is at The Meadows park.

This ChatBot can be accessed from this link: [Parklife Meadows ChatBot](http://edinburghoutdoors.org.uk:3000/lite/parklife-meadows/?m=channel-web&v=Fullscreen).

You can visit this ChatBot to see it in action. The aim of this ChatBot is to collect data from people who visit the park. It is also the ChatBot that is provided as an example in this toolkit.

## Further steps with the ChatBot
